- 👋 Hi, I’m @t0my1z. I´m studying game design in U-tad, and I´ve been working with unity for 3 years.
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and programming game mechanics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in general, focusing on character controllers and other systems like shops, quests, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an action single player game that needs a programmer and mechanics designer.
